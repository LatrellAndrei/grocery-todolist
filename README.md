# Grocery To-Do List App REACT JS

A simple React + Vite project for managing your grocery to-do list.


## Introduction

This project provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. It's designed to serve as a foundation for building a grocery to-do list application.

Currently, two official Vite plugins are available to help with React development:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-react) uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## Features

- **React:** Utilize the power of React for building a responsive and interactive grocery to-do list application.
- **Vite:** Benefit from the fast development and Hot Module Replacement capabilities of Vite.
- **ESLint:** Ensure code quality and maintainability with ESLint rules included in the project.
